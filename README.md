# SAGA
Surrogate Assay for Genotoxicity Assessment

# How to use SAGA
The user needs to put the SAGA script “R_Package_SAGA_V6.R” together with the “SampleInformation.txt”
file, the folder “SAGA_INBUILD” and the sample files (which can be downloaded here (~800 MB)). Everything needs to be in one single folder.

Before using SAGA, the user needs to specify this folder in R by the following command:

setwd("c:/opy your specific folder in here")

Then the script can be sourced or executed row by row. By following this instruction the provided sample files will be analysed. Alternatively, the user can provide his own sample files (Important: the Sampleinformation.txt must be adapted in this case!).

The uploaded PCA plot shows the expected result for the provided sample files.
