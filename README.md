# *S*urrogate *A*ssay for *G*enotoxicity *A*ssessment (SAGA)

In our paper **Predicting genotoxicity of integrating viral vectors for stem cell gene therapy using gene expression-based machine learning**, we report an improved *in vitro* test to determine the risk of insertional mutagenesis of integrating vectors for gene therapy. SAGA builds on the well accepted cell culture protocol of the **_I_**_n_ **_V_**_itro_ **IM**mortalization (**IVIM**) assay but screens for the deregulation of oncogenic gene expression signatures. We demonstrate a new bioinformatic approach to correctly classify the mutagenic potential of retroviral vectors used in previous and current clinical trials.
