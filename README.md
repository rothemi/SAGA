# *S*urrogate *A*ssay for *G*enotoxicity *A*ssessment (SAGA)

In our paper **Predicting genotoxicity of integrating viral vectors for stem cell gene therapy using gene expression-based machine learning**, we report an improved *in vitro* test to determine the risk of insertional mutagenesis of integrating vectors for gene therapy. SAGA builds on the well accepted cell culture protocol of the **_I_**_n_ **_V_**_itro_ **IM**mortalization (**IVIM**) assay but screens for the deregulation of oncogenic gene expression signatures. We demonstrate a new bioinformatic approach to correctly classify the mutagenic potential of retroviral vectors used in previous and current clinical trials.

## Concepts discribed in the  [Paper](./Paper/README.md):
We provide the scripts and R Workspace files used in Schwarzer et al., 2019.

* [Microarray Annotation](./Paper/Microarray%20annotation)

* [Feature Selection](./Paper/Feature%20Selection)

* [Expression Set Analysis](./Paper/Expression%20set%20analysis)

## [SAGA R package](https://talbotsr.com/saga_package/index.html):
We provide the SAGA analysis pipeline as a freely available R-package. [SAGA is hosted and maintained on GitHub by Steven R. Talbot](https://github.com/mytalbot/saga_package).
