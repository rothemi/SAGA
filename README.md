# SAGA
Surrogate Assay for Genotoxicity Assessment

# How to use SAGA
The user needs to put the SAGA script “R_Package_SAGA_V6.R” together with the “SampleInformation.txt”
file, the folder “SAGA_INBUILD” and the sample files (which can be downloaded here (~800 MB)). Everything needs to be in one single folder.

Before using SAGA, the user needs to specify this folder in R by the following command:

setwd("c:/opy your specific folder in here")

Then the script can be sourced or executed row by row.

The uploaded PCA Plot shows the expected result for the sample files.
