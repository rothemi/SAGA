# Feature Selection Final 152 Data Sets

To use all information available, we built the final SAGA classifier on the entire set of available samples (n=152) for use as the training set in the SAGA R-package. The pipeline developed before was applied to the complete dataset and a joint expression matrix of 152 samples was created, on which feature selection was performed, finally arriving at the 11 SAGA predictors.
