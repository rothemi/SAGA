This folder contains R-scripts and input files to reproduce the ROC graphs generated to answer the reviewer's question.
The actual data and other R-scripts to generate Results, Predictions and Confusion Matrices can be inspected and downloaded here:

There is always a file called .RData included. It contains all objects used to generate the results. If the script together with the .RData file is downloaded, the code should run without problems.
