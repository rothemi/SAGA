# Feature Selection with different IQRs
In addition to the main [Feature Selection script](../../Paper/Feature%20Selection/20190306_rfe_GA40_152_10TestSets_IQR0.8_FINAL_median.R) where an IQR of 0.8 was used for nonspecific feature prefiltering, we also constructed the SAGA-SVM classifier with an IQR of [0.5](../../../Paper/Rebuttal/Feature%20Selection%20different%20IQRs/SAGA_FeatureSelection_IQR0.5_GA40/README.md) and [1.2](../../../Paper/Rebuttal/Feature%20Selection%20different%20IQRs/SAGA_FeatureSelection_IQR1.2_GA40/README.md).
